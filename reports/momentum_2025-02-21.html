                <p>Fox operates in two segments: cable networks and television. Cable networks primarily includes Fox News, Fox Business, and several pay-TV sports stations. Television primarily includes the Fox broadcast network, 29 owned and operated local television stations, of which 18 are affiliated with the Fox network, and streaming platform Tubi, which is not subscription-based and is completely ad-supported. Fox effectively sold most of its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, so it no longer creates entertainment content and relies heavily on live news and sports, with nearly all tied to the pay-TV bundle. The Murdoch family controls Fox.</p>
